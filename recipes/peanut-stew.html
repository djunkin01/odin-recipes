            <h3>A stew to stir the soul and awaken the libido</h3>
            <p>This recipe has also been passed down through generations of my family.  Over the years it was lost, found, lost again, until finally I said "To Hell with it" and created my own. So this recipe is actually pretty new</p>
            <p>Starting with a bang and ending with a smush, this recipe is likely to inspire religious inspiration</p>
